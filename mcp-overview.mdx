## What is the Channel3 MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standard that allows AI agents to securely connect to external data sources and tools. Think of it as a bridge that lets your AI assistant access real-world information and take actions beyond just generating text.

The Channel3 MCP specifically gives your AI agents superpowers for product discovery. Your agent can search through millions of real products in real-time, complete with current prices, rich images, detailed descriptions, and real-time availability.

          ],
      },
  ) as mcp_server:
      print("MCP server connected")
      # Initialize the agent with the MCP server
      shopping_agent = Agent[DemoShoppingContext](
          name="Shopping Agent",
          instructions=(
              "You are a personal shopping assistant. "
              "Help the user find the best products for their needs. "
              "You have access to a tool to search the web for products."

          model="gpt-4.1-nano",
          # https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/blob/main/examples/mcp/sse_example/main.py
          mcp_servers=[mcp_server],
      )

      result = Runner.run_streamed(
          shopping_agent,
          input=message,
      )

      for chunk in result:
