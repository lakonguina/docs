## Welcome to Channel3

Channel3 lets developers build AI shopping apps and agents. Whether you're creating a smart recommendation engine, a visual search tool, an agent that purchases products autononmously, or something totally new, Channel3 can power it.

**What can you do with Channel3?**
-   **Create Your Own Catalog:** Curate a catalog of brands and products.
-   **Natural Language Search:** Search like you talk (e.g., "warm winter coat for hiking").
-   **Visual Search:** Find products with an image. This can power a visual search engine, or a visual shopping assistant.
-   **Multimodal Search:** Combine text *and* images for ultra-precise queries (e.g., "blue version of this dress" + image of the dress).
-   **Recommend Products:** Intelligently suggest items your users will love.
-   **Earn Revenue:** Monetize when your customers make purchases.
